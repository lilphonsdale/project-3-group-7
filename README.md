# Background
Our group decided to look at the World Happiness Report dataset, a set of survey responses. Respondents are asked to rank their happiness from 0-10, with 10 being the happiest. The average of each country was taken. Experts then estimated how factors like economic performance, health care, family culture and quality of governance contributed to the national average. 

Our aim in visualizing this dataset is to explain how individual countries responded and why, how responses evolved over time, and how responses compare across countries and regions.

# Motivation
Our motivation to look into this dataset is to understand how people in different countries view their own countries and how they are performing compared to others. The World Happiness Report looks at several aspects such as health(life expectancy), economy, freedom, trust in government, and family dynamics due to the country's ideals. We believe that this is an interesting project as our group members have different backgrounds and want to see how our countries not only compare to the USA but to others. Additionally, with this dataset we will be able to identify any patterns that happen per region. This will allow us to determine if demographics influence indicators. Furthermore, we want to see if this vision of happiness lasts over time or if it changes on a year by year basis. Thus, we will look into the 2015 to 2019 datasets.

By creating a dashboard for this dataset, we hope to answer the below questions through visual representations of the data that dynamically update when various aspects of the data are selected such as different years, countries, regions and contributing factors.

# Questions to answer
Is there a difference in happiness scores between data from
Different years (2015-2019)?
Different countries?
Different regions?
Do all factors contribute equally to the overall happiness score?
Within a country?
Within a region?
Does the contribution of each factor change:
Over time?
Across country/region?
Are some factors better predictors of  overall happiness compared to others? Is this consistent throughout countries/regions?
